Introduction
Stock price prediction is a common problem in financial analysis. In this project, i aim to predict the stock prices of Infosys Company using historical stock price data. Three essential components of stock data are:
* Volume: The total number of shares traded during a given period.
* Opening Price: The price at which a stock starts trading when the market opens.
* Closing Price: The price at which a stock ends trading when the market closes.

I will be using historical stock price data covering the period from January 2, 1996 to August 14, 2023, (BSE Data).

Data Collection: You can download the historical stock price data as a CSV file from your preferred company's website/ official websites of the stock exchanges or can use the provided CSV file in the repository➡️(https://github.com/Meldindavidsabu/Infosys-Stock-Price-Prediction/blob/main/INFOSYS%20STOCK%20(HISTORICAL%20PRICES).csv).
